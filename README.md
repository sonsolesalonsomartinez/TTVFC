# Targeted Time-Varying FC (TTVFC)

TTVFC is a novel approach for studying the temporal dynamics of specific network connections in neuroimaging data.

This model uses a variant of the HMM (i.e., regression-based HMM) and is implemented within the Python toolbox introduced in Vidaurre et al. (2023). Th GLHMM toolbox offers extensive functionality for data preprocessing, model estimation, and result visualization. Detailed documentation and usage instructions are available in the [GLHMM Documentation](https://glhmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

This repository provides code to assess the performance of the regression-based HMM using synthetic data. It demonstrates the model's efficacy in capturing the temporal dynamics of targeted interactions within task contexts.
